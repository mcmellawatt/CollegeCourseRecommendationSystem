Step 1: Download gurobi 6.5.0

    http://user.gurobi.com/download/gurobi-optimizer

Step 2: extract gurobi and set env variables.

    export GUROBI_HOME="/opt/gurobi650/linux64"
    export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"

    (in $GUROBI_HOME/docs there is a quickstart.pdf for each OS if you are
    not using linux and need to check which env variables should be set on
    you system.)

Step 3: connect to GATech VPN

    http://oit.gatech.edu/service/vpn/vpn-service-remote-access

Step 4: Request Univeristy License from gurobi

    http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses/license-center

Step 5: Gurobi's website should give a command like this to run to generate
        your license file.

    grbgetkey xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Step 6: Set Gurobi license env variable to point to your license file.

    export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="/home/jesse/gurobi.lic"

Step 7: I have pushed the gurobi.jar to our github project, it can be
        found in the lib folder. In IntelliJ I had to right click the
        jar file and "Add as library" to get it working.
